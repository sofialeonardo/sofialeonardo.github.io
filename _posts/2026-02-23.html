##Can you call this a blog?

Greetings, internet! Today is Day 15 of my OJT here at THFMI. And I am insufferably bored. 

Not that they don't 'train' me or give me projects, because they do, but today I am practicing sharing. 
By that I mean I am sharing tasks with my co-intern, and while I initially had a hard time doing so because I like working at my own pace, it did take a
load off my back. It had also given us a chance to talk more. It's been fun.

His name is Karl, he's also 21 and we go to the same school, attend the same classes, and every lunch break we go to his house to eat and watch TV.
He is really into frontend development. He likes looking for design inspirations online. Even if it doesn't fit the theme, as long as the design looks cool and
does cool things, it goes into our code. Imagine a digitalized Leave Applications form for company employees with a background that shows the sun during daytime
and the moon in nighttime. "Obra maestra!" - Karl probably.

I am on github right now because apparently the computer people is crazy about this. I'm not chronically online so my knowledge in trends only go as far as 
my school's curriculum would teach me. And they don't teach me a lot. So now I'm trying to compensate--keep up with the times, so they say.

So far I'm one last quiz away from completing a course in Sololearn, I've practiced lot of HTML in W3schools, and for the other free courses on web development, well,
for some reason they don't work on my workstation pc. 

I am on my fourth year! Almost graduating! Yet I feel as if I'm only beginning to study. As if the past three years were just preparatory courses for the
mountain of tools and languages people in this field use. How ever can I get a job! Not to mention a high paying one!

A few days ago, I was introduced to Jose Mujica, a former Uruguayan president. One of his philosophies is that to be free is to need less. Something like that. 
I didn't know much about him but apparently he was very frugal like I like to think I am, and despite being president, he denied the fancy privileges he could get. 
I admired that, to be honest, and for a moment he inspired me to become like him too. But it is unfair to compare my situation to his. He had the option to be fancy.
I don't. I was born into a society that has programmed me to either be a poor worthless filler queen or a poor slave to capitalism. I was born to be taught that the
only way up is their ladder. So maybe you aren't always right, Jose Mujica! Some people can't choose to live 'simply'! I have a family. I want to leave this earth with the power to take care of
them even after I die.

Death! What a thought. I am at the point of my life where I think aging is a privilege. I like seeing signs of aging in my face. I know I'm only 21, but seeing myself
grow into the body of an adult woman is empowering. I never thought I'd make it this far. As a kid most of the films I watched had 20+ year olds doing crazy things,
and back then I felt that I had to prepare for those things to happen to me too. But so far my life has thankfully been boring. Like today. 

God am I bored. I hope Karl lets go of our frontend so we can setup our coordinates when we finally print user inputs in the company's pre-printed leave application form.
Yesterday we talked about going out tonight after our shift. When he was driving me to the terminal we saw a baked potato stall on the way. We're trying it tonight.
There is one near our school called Spudbay, and while the toppings have real mozzarella(sp?), the potato was too heavy you'd want to vomit it halfway through.
So if you want to enjoy it you'd have to fast after lunch, which we are doing right now. He is so excited; he has been giving me notes all day talking about tonight.
For the 2 and a half years we've been together he had always shown childlike excitement in every meal. Be it a piece of fried egg or an expensive meal, he loves them all the same.

It's growing on me too, his excitement. I used to have a bad relationship with food because I spent a lof of my teenage years being obsessed with beauty. It consumed me.
I gain the weight I lose, I lose the weight I gain. When I met Karl he didn't care about any of that. He liked me not for what I look (although I always appreciate
a compliment on my appearance), but for who I am and what I am made of. And for the last 3 years, a huge chunk of myself has been Karl, and if god forbid that he leaves,
he'll be leaving me with a Karl-shaped hole in my heart. 

Baked potato!!! 

I wish I had a grammar checker right now.
